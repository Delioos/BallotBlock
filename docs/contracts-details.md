# DAO System Architecture

## Overview

This DAO system implements a flexible and secure decentralized autonomous organization with membership NFTs, proposal management, treasury control, and execution strategies. The system is built with security-first principles and includes multiple safety mechanisms.

## Core Components

### 1. DAOFactory
Reference: `contracts/src/DAOFactory.sol`

The factory contract manages DAO creation and tracking with the following features:
- Standardized DAO deployment with configurable parameters
- Registry of all created DAOs
- Pausable deployment functionality
- Default governance parameters management

Security features:
- Input validation for all parameters
- ReentrancyGuard for deployment
- Pagination for DAO listing to prevent gas limits
- Owner-controlled emergency pause

### 2. DAO
The main DAO contract coordinates all components and manages:
- Membership NFT control
- Proposal creation and execution
- Treasury operations
- Access control through Ownable pattern

Key security mechanisms:
- Only owner can create proposals
- Modular design for component upgrades
- Event emission for all important actions
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. DAOMembership (ERC721)
Features:
- Membership NFTs with voting power
- Royalty management
- Pausable transfers
- Burn functionality

Security measures:
- Immutable DAO address
- ReentrancyGuard for minting/burning
- Voting power limits
- Only DAO can mint new tokens
- Pausable for emergencies

### 4. ProposalManager
Manages the governance process with:
- Proposal lifecycle management
- Voting mechanism
- Quorum tracking
- Execution strategy integration

Security features:
- Timelock for execution
- Value limits for transactions
- Quorum requirements
- Vote delegation prevention
- Double-vote protection

### 5. Treasury
Handles all financial operations:
- ETH and ERC20 token management
- Transaction execution
- Balance tracking

Security mechanisms:
- Value limits per transaction
- Timelock for large transactions
- Only DAO can withdraw
- Balance tracking per token

## Security Mechanisms

### Access Control
1. Ownership hierarchy:
```mermaid
graph TD
    Owner --> DAOFactory
    DAOFactory --> DAO
    DAO --> |controls| DAOMembership
    DAO --> |controls| ProposalManager
    DAO --> |controls| Treasury
```

2. Function-level protection:
- onlyOwner modifiers
- onlyDAO checks
- Delegation restrictions

### Safety Measures
1. Pausable functionality:
- Emergency pause for all contracts
- Separate pause states per component
- Only owner can pause/unpause

2. Value Limits:
- Maximum transaction values
- Quorum requirements
- Voting power caps

3. Timelocks:
- Proposal execution delay
- Large transaction delays
- Voting periods

### Event Emission
All important state changes emit events for:
- DAO creation/updates
- Membership changes
- Proposal lifecycle
- Voting activities
- Treasury operations

## Deployment Flow

1. Deploy DAOFactory with initial parameters
2. Create new DAO through factory
3. DAO deployment automatically creates:
   - Membership NFT contract
   - Proposal Manager
   - Treasury

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating a DAO
```solidity
// Example DAO creation
DAOFactory factory = DAOFactory(factoryAddress);
address newDao = factory.createDAO(
    "MyDAO",
    "Membership Token",
    "MDAO",
    500 // 5% royalty
);
```

### Proposal Lifecycle
1. Creation: Only DAO owner can create proposals
2. Voting Period: Members vote based on voting power
3. Execution: After timelock and if quorum reached
4. Optional cancellation by DAO owner

### Treasury Management
- Value limits protect against large unauthorized transfers
- Timelocks for significant transactions
- Clear separation between proposal and execution

## Upgradeability

The system is designed with modularity in mind:
- Components can be replaced individually
- State is properly separated
- Clear interfaces between components

## Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Proposal creation limits
   - Voting power adjustments
   - Transaction value caps

2. **Access Control**
   - Hierarchical permissions
   - Function-level checks
   - Component isolation

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - System-wide pause
   - Component-level pause
   - Owner override capabilities

## Future Improvements

1. Planned Features:
   - Advanced execution strategies
   - Token-based voting power
   - Multi-signature support

2. Potential Enhancements:
   - Upgradeable contracts
   - More flexible voting mechanisms
   - Enhanced treasury management
